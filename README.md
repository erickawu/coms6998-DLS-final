# COMS6998 S21 Final Project

## Accessing and running training data & notebook

To download the QuickDraw data, clone the repository and run the following command while in the main repository folder `coms6998-DLS-final`:

```
python model_resources/DataUtils/prepare_data.py -c 100 -d 1 -show
```

to populate the folders `data` with 100 .npy files downloaded from Google Quickdraw and `dataset` with training and testsing files consisting of a total of 5000 samples (80-20 split) each from the 100 QuickDraw classes.

Run cells in `model/clip_quickdraw_zeroshot.ipynb` to test CLIP accuracy on the Quickdraw dataset & train/fine-tune the model as you see fit.

## Local Web Server

To deploy the web server to play Pictionary game powered by the model (it'll label your sketches!):

1. Clone this repository, and clone the OpenAI CLIP repository at https://github.com/openai/CLIP into the CLIP folder.
2. Make sure that `pipenv` is installed
3. Install dependencies by running `pipenv install`
4. Start the local web server with `FLASK_APP=app/app.py DEBUG_MODE=1 pipenv run flask run` (you can also turn off debug mode if you want)

## Prod web server

1. Pipenv install dependencies
2. From the root directory, run `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app.app:app`
